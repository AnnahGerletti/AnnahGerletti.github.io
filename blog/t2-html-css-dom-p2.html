    What is grid base design?
    <p>Grid based designs are a way of creating an athletically pleasing website, using a grid pattern. The information is presented to the viewer in a grid layout with the most important info at the top with the less important further down the page.
    </p>

    What's all the hype about responsive websites?
    <p>A responsive site is one that does not have a fixed size to allow viewing from any device size. The website will automatically resize correctly to look good and be legible.
    </p>

    What is semantic structure?
    <p>Semantic code is code written in a way so your computer can understand what you are asking. It also follows a specific structure, such as: h1, h2, h3, h4 and so on.
    </p>

    Other points to reflect on.
    <p>Building with responsive design in mind using the grid layout is important. I still have not gotten my head around this kind of design. How its set up or how it works. Also dividing everything into 1/12 made my head hurt.
