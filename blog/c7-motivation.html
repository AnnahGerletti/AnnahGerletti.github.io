            <h4>How does life look through the ‘pleasure, passion and purpose’ lens?</h4>
             <p>
               As a late millennial I have a tendency to chase after the pleasure happiness, because this kind of happiness can have instant gratification. Unfortunately, as the book said this type of happiness is not sustainable.
             </p><br>

             <p>
               I have never felt like I had a higher purpose just working day to day. I think gaining happiness with the motivation of a higher purpose would make you feel good about your life. Instead of feeling like you have to accomplish something each and every day. At the moment I do not live like this but would like to work towards a life style where I know the values that are the most meaningful to myself.
