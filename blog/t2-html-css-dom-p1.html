  Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
    <p>These concepts can be described with a house analogy. HTML is the structure, walls rooms etc.CSS is how you styled your place, colors of walls type of carpet and so on. While DOM is how guests (aka browsers) engage with the space. It can also create floor plan or layout of the design of the house.
