    What did you take from the chapter?
    <div class="textlist">I learned how to train your emotional intelligence with three easy setps.
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Attention training - training your mind to be calm and focused on demand</li>
        <li>Self-knowledge and self-mastery - realising I am not my emotions and they are not me.</li>
        <li>Create useful mantal habits - habit forming is simple but you have to train yourself with repetition of thought which will turn into character and then personality</li>
    </ol></div>

    How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?

    <p>I think kindness and being aware of your mind are very important, however it can be hard to always act with this type of mindfulness. It takes lots and lots of practice to achieve a habit like this. One I will work towards every day because this is something I want to accomplish in my life.
